# Analyzing data on Thanksgiving Dinner using Pandas

I worked with Jupyter notebook, and analyzed data on Thanksgiving dinner in the US using Pandas library. The dataset came from FiveThirtyEight.
The dataset is stored in the thanksgiving.csv file. It contains 1058 responses to an online survey about what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner. Each survey respondent was asked questions about what they typically eat for Thanksgiving, along with some demographic questions, like their gender, income, and location. This dataset will allow us to discover regional and income-based patterns in what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner.
